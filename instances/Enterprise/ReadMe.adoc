== Changelog

Nordic44 follows *Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (link:https://semver.org/[SemVer])* with support for **pre-release versions**:  
`{Major}.{Minor}.{Patch}-{PreRelease}.{Iteration}`  

- **Major (`X.0.0`)** â€“ Significant, non-backwards-compatible changes. E.g. transition to a new version of CGMES.
- **Minor (`X.Y.0`)** â€“ Backwards-compatible improvements. E.g. adding significant set of object that is compatible with the profile. The dataset should conform to the same profile. Adding a new dataset shall require minor version upgrade.
- **Patch (`X.Y.Z`)** â€“ Minor fixes or adjustment with no impact on structure. E.g. adding attribute to existing object or create new object of type that already exist in the dataset.
- **Pre-release (`alpha`, `beta`)** â€“ Versions that may undergo further revisions prior to final release.
- **Iteration (`X`)** â€“ Incremental release number within `alpha` or `beta`.  Sequential number for the pre-release phase.

=== Examples:

- 3.0.0-alpha.1 â€“ First alpha version (early-stage, subject to major revisions).
- 3.0.0-beta.3 â€“ Third beta release (more stable, but could still change).
- 3.0.0 â€“ Finalised version.
