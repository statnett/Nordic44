= Naming Specification

== Background

The Common Information Model (CIM) uses UUID-based identifiers (`cim:Identification.mRID`) to uniquely reference objects. While effective for computer processing, these UUIDs are impractical for human readability and interaction with large-language models (LLMs). Hence, there is a need for a human-readable naming specification for any test data generated by a computer. The names should not be decomposed to create any computer processing, it is purely made for human-readability.

== Scope

This naming specification details the structured content of `cim:IdentifiedObject.name` and `cim:IdentifiedObject.description` fields within CIM. It aims to enhance human and LLM usability, facilitating easier object identification through clear and intuitive naming conventions.

In general, we would like to adapt the Resource Description Specification (RDS) as specified in IEC 81346-1:2022, directly - particularly the concept of aspects is very relevant information to the users.

== RDS Aspect Prefixes

|===
| Aspect            | RDS Code         | Usage
| Function          | "=" (Equals sign)  | Relating to the function aspect of the object
| Product           | "-" (Minus sign)   | Relating to the product aspects of the object
| Host installation | "+" (Plus sign)    | Relating to the host installation aspect
| Site installation | "++" (Double Plus) | Relating to the site installation aspect
| Type              | "%" (Percent sign) | Relating to the type aspect
| Management        | "#" (Number sign)  | Relating to the management aspect

=== Evaluation of RDS Aspects

In CIM, each aspect is represented by a uniquely identifiable object, where RDS indicates the aspects is identified by their RDS codes. The detailed mapping of these RDS aspects to CIM is not worked out yet. CIM does not operate with any naming standard since it is considered too difficult to get international agreement. CIM has its own 'cim:Name' and 'cim:NameType' model that can support all different type of names. The plan is to add tagging of RDS name type in CIM18.

==== Special Character Challenges

Characters such as '=', '+', '%', and '#' can conflict with programming language syntax, configuration formats, or data serialization rules. 

These symbols are not intuitive unless the user is trained in the RDS standard.

==== Examples of Special Character Conflicts

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Character | Conflict Example
| =       | In many languages, = is used for assignment. For example, in Python: name = "value". If used in names, it can break parsers or scripts interpreting these strings.
| +       | Commonly interpreted as addition. In command-line tools or regex patterns, it has special meaning (e.g., grep or regex engines where + means one or more).
| %       | Used as a modulo operator in languages like C, Java, and Python. In formats like URL encoding (%20), it triggers decoding logic.
| #       | Typically marks a comment in shell scripts and many configuration formats. If a name includes #, content after may be ignored by parsers.

These characters reduce the portability and robustness of identifiers across different tools, systems, and languages.

== Naming Convention

We define the following prefixes, avoiding special characters:

| Aspect     | Prefix | Usage                                                                    | CIM Class
| System     | S      | Represents the system perspective.                                       | PowerSystemResource and subtypes
| Product    | P      | Represents the product perspective (manufacturer, etc.).                 | AssetInfo and subtypes
| Deployment | D      | Installed asset configuration.                                           | AssetDeployment and subtypes
| Asset      | A      | Represents the individual asset with serial number.                     | Asset and subtypes
| Location   | L      | Physical or logical location.                                            | Location and subtypes
|===

== Norwegian Special Characters

Avoid Norwegian-specific characters:

- Æ, æ → Ae, ae
- Ø, ø → Oe, oe
- Å, å → Aa, aa

Use `_` as a separator to meet `xsd:token` requirements.

== Naming Structure Codes

[cols="1,3,1", options="header"]

| Code         | Interpretation                                   | Example
| <Sub>        | Name of the substation                           | Arendal
| <VL>         | Voltage level or nominal voltage                 | 132kV
| <FD>         | Feeder or logical group name                     | Engene
| <Man>         | Manufacturer of the asset                       | Schneider
| <SN>         | Serial number (cim:Asset.serialNumber)           | SN2345
| <SEQ>        | Sequence number                                  | 2
| <A-SEQ>       | Alphabetical sequence, A, B, C etc              | A
| <SubA>-<SubB>| Line between two substations, alphabetical order | Arendal-Froland

== Rule Explanation Example: `cim:ACLineSegment`

*Rule*: S_<VL>_<SubA>-<SubB>_ACLS_<SEQ>

`cim:IdentifiedObject.name` = 'S_132kV_Arendal-Froland_ACLS_1'

`cim:IdentifiedObject.description` = 'S 132kV Arendal-Froland ACLineSegment 1'


[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Component | Meaning
| S         | System perspective
| 132kV     | Voltage level
| Arendal-Froland | Connected substations
| ACLS      | ACLineSegment CIM class abbreviation
| 1         | First instance (sequence number)
